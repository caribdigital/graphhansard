## 1. Executive Strategic Assessment: The 14th Parliament in 2026

### 1.1 The Political Landscape of the Mid-to-Late Term

As of February 2026, the Commonwealth of The Bahamas is navigating the mature phase of its 14th Parliamentary term, a period defined by the consolidation of the Progressive Liberal Party's (PLP) "New Day" agenda and the crystallized fragmentation of the Official Opposition. The legislative body, seated in the historic House of Assembly in Nassau, comprises 39 single-member constituencies. The current balance of power reflects a commanding supermajority for the governing PLP, which holds **32 seats**, compared to the FNM's **6 seats** and the Coalition of Independents' (COI) **1 seat**. This three-party configuration — unprecedented in the modern House — emerged in April 2025 when Central Grand Bahama MP Iram Lewis defected from the FNM to the COI.

The PLP's dominance is not merely a statistical artifact of the landslide 2021 General Election but has been reinforced by strategic victories in two critical by-elections: **West Grand Bahama and Bimini** (November 2023) following Obie Wilchcombe's death, and **Golden Isles** (November 2025) following Vaughn Miller's death.

The leadership structure of the country remains stable under Prime Minister Philip Edward "Brave" Davis, K.C., whose administration has pivoted from crisis management — specifically the post-Hurricane Dorian recovery and the COVID-19 economic fallout — toward long-term structural reforms in energy, digitization, and constitutional sovereignty. The Opposition, led by the Hon. Michael Pintard, faces the triple challenge of holding the government accountable, managing internal fissures (particularly the continued influence of former Prime Minister Dr. Hubert Minnis on the backbench), and coping with the defection of Iram Lewis which reduced the FNM caucus to its smallest parliamentary footprint in modern history.

### 1.2 The "New Day" Governance Model

The Davis administration's governance model is characterized by a "strong cabinet" system, where executive power is broadly distributed among senior ministers yet centrally coordinated by the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). The administration has maintained a large executive footprint, with the vast majority of PLP MPs holding either substantive Cabinet portfolios, Minister of State designations, or Parliamentary Secretary roles. This strategy serves two purposes: it ensures deep oversight of the bureaucracy and maintains party discipline by integrating the legislative caucus into the executive payroll.

Conversely, the FNM's parliamentary caucus of just 6 members (down from 7 at election) severely limits its ability to effectively shadow every government ministry. The Opposition has had to rely on a "zone defense" strategy, where single MPs cover multiple shadow portfolios, often aided by Senators. This structural imbalance is a defining feature of the 2021–2026 parliamentary dynamic, often leading to lopsided debates in the Lower House where government ministers can overwhelm opposition shadow ministers with departmental data and resources.

## 2. Directorate of the House of Assembly

The functioning of the House is predicated on the impartiality and authority of the Speaker. In the 14th Parliament, this role has been pivotal in managing the heightened tensions between the expansive government bench and the aggressive, though small, opposition.

### 2.1 Speaker of the House

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Legal Name** | Patricia Ann Deveaux |
| **Constituency** | Bamboo Town (New Providence) |
| **Party** | Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) |
| **Role** | Speaker of the House of Assembly |
| **Aliases/Nicknames** | "Pat", "Madam Speaker" |
| **First Elected** | 2021 (defeated FNM incumbent Renward Wells) |
| **Prior Experience** | Seasoned PLP political operative; organizational leader in Bamboo Town |

**Entity Analysis:** Patricia Deveaux made history in 2021 as the second woman to ascend to the Chair of the House. Her tenure has been characterized by strict adherence to the Standing Orders, often leading to clashes with Opposition Leader Michael Pintard. Before her speakership, Deveaux was known for her organizational skills in the Bamboo Town constituency. Her election to the seat in 2021 was a decisive victory over FNM incumbent Renward Wells, signaling the collapse of FNM support in middle-class New Providence. As Speaker, she does not hold a cabinet portfolio, maintaining the constitutional separation of the legislative presiding officer from the executive branch. Her management of the House is central to the government's ability to pass its heavy legislative agenda, including annual budgetary appropriations and the contentious energy reform bills of 2024–2025.

### 2.2 Deputy Speaker

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Legal Name** | McKell D. Bonaby |
| **Constituency** | Mount Moriah (New Providence) |
| **Party** | Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) |
| **Role** | Deputy Speaker; Executive Chairman (Straw Market Authority) |
| **Aliases/Nicknames** | "McKell" |
| **Profession** | Attorney-at-law |
| **First Elected** | 2021 |

**Entity Analysis:** McKell Bonaby represents the new generation of PLP leadership. His role as Deputy Speaker involves relieving the Speaker during long debates and chairing the Committee of the Whole House. Beyond legislative duties, Bonaby holds the politically sensitive executive chairmanship of the Straw Market Authority, as the Straw Market vendors are a powerful interest group in downtown Nassau. His dual mandate highlights the PLP's strategy of placing backbenchers in charge of statutory boards to extend political oversight. Mount Moriah is a critical middle-class battleground constituency.

## 3. The Executive Branch: Cabinet Ministers and Portfolios

The executive core of the Bahamas Government is drawn exclusively from Parliament (House and Senate). The Davis government has appointed nearly its entire 32-member PLP caucus to executive roles — a feature of small-chamber governance where the ruling party's backbench is virtually nonexistent.

Two major cabinet reshuffles reshaped portfolios: the **September 3, 2023 reshuffle** (promoting Campbell and Glover-Rolle from Ministers of State to full Cabinet; shifting Sweeting from Agriculture to Works, Sears from Works to Immigration, Bell from Labour/Immigration to Housing, and assigning Coleby-Davis the Energy portfolio) and the **January 2, 2024 adjustments** following Obie Wilchcombe's death (promoting LaRoda to full Minister and Lundy to Minister of State).

### 3.1 Prime Minister and Minister of Finance

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Legal Name** | Philip Edward Davis, K.C. |
| **Constituency** | Cat Island, Rum Cay & San Salvador (Family Island) |
| **Party** | Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) |
| **Role** | Prime Minister and Minister of Finance |
| **Aliases/Nicknames** | **"Brave"** (universally used; inherited from father, a Cat Island firefighter); "Papa" (less common, inherited from Christie-era context) |
| **Post-Nominals** | K.C. (King's Counsel) |
| **First Elected** | 1992 (by-election); lost 1997; won 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017, 2021 |
| **Prior Roles** | Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Works (2012–2017); PLP Deputy Leader |

**Entity Analysis:** Philip "Brave" Davis is the dominant political figure in The Bahamas. Representing the southern island constituency of Cat Island, Rum Cay, and San Salvador since 2002 (with a brief earlier stint from a 1992 by-election through 1997), he has cultivated an image of resilience — hence the alias "Brave." As Minister of Finance, he has retained direct control over the nation's treasury, eschewing the appointment of a separate finance minister, signaling his hands-on approach to fiscal recovery. His tenure has focused on "climate justice" internationally and the "Blue Economy" domestically. In 2026, his primary political objective is managing succession planning within the party while preparing for a re-election bid that relies heavily on his personal brand of stability.

### 3.2 Deputy Prime Minister

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Legal Name** | Isaac Chester Cooper |
| **Constituency** | The Exumas and Ragged Island (Family Island) |
| **Party** | Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) |
| **Role** | Deputy Prime Minister; Minister of Tourism, Investments and Aviation |
| **Aliases/Nicknames** | **"Chester"** (never uses "Isaac" publicly) |
| **First Elected** | 2017; re-elected 2021 |
| **Background** | Former CEO in insurance and financial services sector |

**Entity Analysis:** Chester Cooper is the technocratic face of the administration. His constituency, Exuma, is the jewel of the Bahamian tourism product, and his portfolio perfectly aligns with his electoral base. Cooper is widely viewed as the heir apparent to PLP leadership. His management of the post-pandemic tourism rebound — shattering arrival records in 2023 and 2024 — is the cornerstone of his political capital. He operates with a high degree of autonomy in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). He frequently serves as Acting Prime Minister alongside Glenys Hanna-Martin, underscoring his seniority.

### 3.3 Senior Cabinet Ministers

#### Minister of Foreign Affairs; PLP Chairman

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Legal Name** | Frederick Audley Mitchell |
| **Constituency** | Fox Hill (New Providence) |
| **Party** | Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) |
| **Role** | Minister of Foreign Affairs; PLP Chairman |
| **Aliases/Nicknames** | **"Fred"**; **"Foxy"** (colloquial nod to Fox Hill constituency) |
| **First Elected** | 2002; re-elected 2007, 2012, 2017, 2021 (five consecutive terms) |
| **Prior Roles** | Minister of Foreign Affairs (2002–2007, 2012–2017) |

**Entity Analysis:** Fred Mitchell is the strategist and ideologue of the PLP. As Party Chairman, he controls the political machinery; as Foreign Minister, he directs the nation's diplomatic corps. Fox Hill — a historic village formed by freed slaves — is his political fortress, though he faces perennial challenges due to the area's shifting demographics. Mitchell is known for his daily voice notes and aggressive defense of the party line in media. His alias "Foxy" is a colloquial nod to his constituency.

#### Minister of Education and Technical and Vocational Training

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Legal Name** | Glenys Margaret E. Hanna-Martin |
| **Constituency** | Englerston (New Providence) |
| **Party** | Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) |
| **Role** | Minister of Education and Technical and Vocational Training |
| **Aliases/Nicknames** | "Glenys", "GHM" |
| **Maiden Name** | Hanna |
| **Family** | Daughter of the late Governor-General Arthur D. Hanna |
| **First Elected** | 2002; multiple consecutive terms |
| **Distinction** | Longest-serving female parliamentarian in Bahamian history |

**Entity Analysis:** Glenys Hanna-Martin represents Englerston, a dense working-class constituency considered the safest PLP seat in the country. She carries a dynastic legacy of left-leaning, nationalist politics. Her portfolio in Education is one of the most challenging, tasked with reversing "learning loss" from the COVID-19 era. She frequently serves as Acting Prime Minister, underscoring her seniority.

#### Minister of Health and Wellness

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Legal Name** | Dr. Michael Ronald Darville |
| **Constituency** | Tall Pines (New Providence) |
| **Party** | Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) |
| **Role** | Minister of Health and Wellness |
| **Aliases/Nicknames** | "Mike", **"Doc"** |
| **First Elected** | 2012 (Grand Bahama); lost 2017; returned 2021 (Tall Pines, New Providence) |
| **Background** | Physician (rare constituency migration from Grand Bahama to New Providence) |

**Entity Analysis:** Originally a Grand Bahama MP, Dr. Darville successfully migrated to the New Providence seat of Tall Pines in 2021 — a rare feat in Bahamian politics. As Minister of Health, he has overseen the construction of new clinics and the planning of a new hospital in New Providence. His professional background as a physician is central to his political identity, giving him credibility on healthcare matters that few other MPs possess.

#### Minister of Immigration and National Insurance

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Legal Name** | Alfred Michael Sears, K.C. |
| **Constituency** | Fort Charlotte (New Providence) |
| **Party** | Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) |
| **Role** | Minister of Immigration and National Insurance |
| **Aliases/Nicknames** | "Alfred" |
| **Post-Nominals** | K.C. (King's Counsel) |
| **First Elected** | 2002; lost 2007; returned 2021 after long absence |
| **Prior Roles** | Attorney General (Christie administration); initially Minister of Works (2021–2023), reshuffled to Immigration |

**Entity Analysis:** Alfred Sears is the intellectual heavyweight of the Cabinet. His reshuffle from Works to Immigration in September 2023 was strategic, placing a legal mind in charge of the sensitive immigration portfolio amidst rising nationalist sentiment regarding border control. Fort Charlotte is a swing constituency, and Sears' hold on it relies heavily on personal prestige and community roots.

#### Minister of National Security; Leader of Government Business

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Legal Name** | Wayne R. Munroe, K.C. |
| **Constituency** | Freetown (New Providence) |
| **Party** | Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) |
| **Role** | Minister of National Security; Leader of Government Business in the House |
| **Aliases/Nicknames** | "Wayne" |
| **Post-Nominals** | K.C. (King's Counsel) |
| **First Elected** | 2021 |
| **Background** | Prominent criminal defense attorney |
| **Note** | Assumed Leader of Government Business role after Obie Wilchcombe's death (Sept 2023) |

**Entity Analysis:** Representing Freetown (formerly Montagu), Wayne Munroe transitioned from prominent criminal defense attorney to the nation's chief law enforcement minister. His tenure has been defined by a "tough on crime" approach, heavily integrating technology (ShotSpotter, CCTV) into policing. He is often referred to by his legal post-nominal "KC" in formal settings. His constituency is an affluent/mixed area in eastern New Providence.

#### Minister of Works and Family Island Affairs

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Legal Name** | Clay Glennford Sweeting |
| **Constituency** | Central and South Eleuthera (Family Island) |
| **Party** | Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) |
| **Role** | Minister of Works and Family Island Affairs |
| **Aliases/Nicknames** | "Clay" |
| **First Elected** | 2021 |
| **Background** | Fisherman and businessman from Spanish Wells |

**Entity Analysis:** Clay Sweeting's rise has been meteoric. He represents a demographic (white Bahamians from the Family Islands) that has traditionally leaned FNM. His success in Central and South Eleuthera and subsequent performance as Minister of Agriculture led to his promotion to the powerful Ministry of Works in the September 2023 reshuffle. He is now responsible for the nation's physical infrastructure, a portfolio with massive budgetary weight, and is considered a rising star in the PLP.

#### Minister of Energy and Transport

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Legal Name** | JoBeth Lillian Coleby-Davis |
| **Constituency** | Elizabeth (New Providence) |
| **Party** | Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) |
| **Role** | Minister of Energy and Transport |
| **Aliases/Nicknames** | "JoBeth" |
| **Maiden Name** | Coleby |
| **First Elected** | 2021 (defeated FNM heavyweight Dr. Duane Sands) |

**Entity Analysis:** JoBeth Coleby-Davis is a standout performer in the Davis administration. Defeating the FNM heavyweight Dr. Duane Sands in 2021, she secured the swing seat of Elizabeth. Initially Minister of Housing and Transport, she was assigned the critical Energy portfolio in the September 2023 reshuffle to tackle the crisis at Bahamas Power and Light (BPL). Her aggressive reform agenda, including the integration of solar power and LNG, marks her as a central figure in the government's "Green Economy" push.

#### Minister of Housing and Urban Renewal

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Legal Name** | Keith Ricardo Bell |
| **Constituency** | Carmichael (New Providence) |
| **Party** | Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) |
| **Role** | Minister of Housing and Urban Renewal |
| **Aliases/Nicknames** | "Keith" |
| **First Elected** | 2021 |
| **Background** | Former high-ranking police officer |

**Entity Analysis:** Keith Bell's current role places him at the forefront of the government's social welfare agenda, specifically the construction of affordable subdivisions in the Carmichael area, one of the fastest-growing and most populous constituencies in The Bahamas. Moved from Labour/Immigration to Housing in the September 2023 reshuffle.

#### Minister of Labour and the Public Service; Deputy Leader of Government Business

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Legal Name** | Pia Takita Glover-Rolle |

| **Party** | Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) |
| **Role** | Minister of Labour and the Public Service; Deputy Leader of Government Business |
| **Aliases/Nicknames** | "Pia" |
| **Maiden Name** | Glover |
| **First Elected** | 2021 |
| **Background** | Human resources professional |
| **Note** | Elevated from Minister of State to full Cabinet Minister (Sept 2023); assumed Deputy Leader of Government Business after Wilchcombe's death |

**Entity Analysis:** Pia Glover-Rolle has managed the government's relationship with public sector unions, successfully negotiating multiple industrial agreements in 2022–2024. Her focus in 2026 is on digitization of the public service and implementation of a new public sector wage scale. Golden Gates is a middle-class constituency that demands high standards of service delivery.

#### Minister for Grand Bahama

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Legal Name** | Ginger Maria Moxey |
| **Constituency** | Pineridge (Grand Bahama) |
| **Party** | Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) |
| **Role** | Minister for Grand Bahama |
| **Aliases/Nicknames** | **"Ginger"** (common name; sometimes "Virginia" in older records) |
| **First Elected** | 2021 |

**Entity Analysis:** As Minister for Grand Bahama, Ginger Moxey is the "governor" of the nation's second major economic zone. Her mandate involves the complex revitalization of Freeport, dealing with the Grand Bahama Port Authority (GBPA), and the sale of the Grand Lucayan hotel. Pineridge was a hard-fought victory in 2021, and her re-election prospects are tied directly to the economic performance of Freeport. She is the PLP's executive authority on the island.

#### Minister of Agriculture and Marine Resources

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Legal Name** | Jomo Chaka Campbell |
| **Constituency** | Centreville (New Providence) |
| **Party** | Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) |
| **Role** | Minister of Agriculture and Marine Resources |
| **Aliases/Nicknames** | "Jomo" |
| **First Elected** | 2021 (succeeded former PM Perry Christie in Centreville) |
| **Background** | Attorney-at-law |
| **Note** | Elevated from Minister of State to full Cabinet Minister (late 2023) |

**Entity Analysis:** Jomo Campbell represents the "New Guard" but sits in a constituency deeply rooted in the "Old Guard" tradition — Centreville was held by former PM Perry Christie for decades. Elevated to Cabinet in late 2023, his focus on food security aims to reduce the national import bill.

#### Minister of Youth, Sports and Culture

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Legal Name** | Mario Keith Bowleg |
| **Constituency** | Garden Hills (New Providence) |
| **Party** | Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) |
| **Role** | Minister of Youth, Sports and Culture |
| **Aliases/Nicknames** | "Mario", **"Coach"** (widely used by constituents and colleagues) |
| **First Elected** | 2021 |
| **Background** | Sports administration (basketball) |

**Entity Analysis:** Mario Bowleg's alias "Coach" is widely used. His ministry is critical for engaging the youth demographic, a key voting bloc. Garden Hills is a densely populated working-class area in New Providence.

#### Minister of Social Services, Information and Broadcasting

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Legal Name** | Myles Kentworth LaRoda |
| **Constituency** | Pinewood (New Providence) |
| **Party** | Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) |
| **Role** | Minister of Social Services, Information and Broadcasting |
| **Aliases/Nicknames** | "Myles" |
| **Spelling Variants** | "Laroda" / "LaRoda" (varies across sources) |
| **First Elected** | 2021 |
| **Note** | Promoted to full Minister in January 2024 adjustments |

**Entity Analysis:** Pinewood is notorious for flooding; LaRoda's success depends in part on drainage infrastructure projects in his constituency. His elevation to full minister following the January 2024 cabinet adjustments gave him oversight of the social welfare safety net.

### 3.4 Ministers of State

**Basil Walton McIntosh** — Represents MICAL (Mayaguana, Inagua, Crooked Island, Acklins, Long Cay), the most logistically challenging constituency in the southern archipelago. His role in Aviation is crucial for maintaining "lifeline" flights to these remote islands. Defeated FNM incumbent Miriam Emmanuel in 2021.

**Zane Enrico Lightbourne** — Minister of State for Environment. An educator and trade unionist who succeeded Melanie Griffin in the Yamacraw constituency. His portfolio may expand or be reassigned following Vaughn Miller's death, which left the full Minister of Environment position in flux.

**Kingsley Smith** — See Section 5.5 for detailed by-election entity profile.

**John H.W. Pinder II** — A white Bahamian from a prominent Abaco family. His election in 2021 was a watershed moment, as Abaco was traditionally FNM country.

## 5. Strategic Analysis: The Opposition's Shadow Government

The Free National Movement, with only **6 MPs** (reduced from 7 at election by Lewis's defection), faces a profound structural disadvantage. The Shadow Cabinet is a hybrid entity relying on MPs to double-hat portfolios and utilizing Senators to fill gaps.

| Shadow Portfolio | Responsible Entity (MP) | Analysis |
|-----------------|------------------------|----------|
| Leader of the Opposition | Michael Pintard (Marco City) | Orchestrates overall strategy; focuses on Grand Bahama development and governance |
| Finance | Kwasi Thompson (East Grand Bahama) | Primary attack dog on budget issues; frequently clashes with PM Davis on deficit reporting |
| National Security | Shanendon Cartwright (St. Barnabas) | Focuses on crime rate; challenges Minister Munroe's statistics |
| Legal Affairs (Shadow AG) | Adrian White (St. Anne's) | Highlights legislative drafting errors and constitutional overreach |
| Health | *Vacant in House* | Usually covered by Dr. Duane Sands (FNM Party Chairman, non-MP) outside the House |
| Long Island / Water | Adrian Gibson (Long Island) | Inactive in shadow role due to conflict of interest with pending trial |
| Former PM / Killarney | Dr. Hubert Minnis (Killarney) | Operates as a "wildcard," frequently diverging from official shadow cabinet positions |

**Critical Insight:** The absence of a dedicated Shadow Minister for Health or Education within the House allows Ministers Darville and Hanna-Martin to dominate parliamentary debates with minimal direct pushback from elected opposition peers.

**The COI Factor:** Iram Lewis (Central Grand Bahama) sits as the sole COI representative. While he does not participate in the FNM's shadow cabinet, his departure weakened the Opposition's numbers and muddied the FNM's Grand Bahama narrative. The COI, led by Lincoln Bain (non-MP), now has a parliamentary voice for the first time.

## 9. Conclusion: The Path to the 2026/2027 Election

As the 14th Parliament enters its final legislative cycle, the entity landscape is stable but charged with underlying tension. The PLP, holding 32 seats and bolstered by two successful by-election defenses, is in a commanding position. The executive branch, led by Prime Minister Davis and Deputy Prime Minister Cooper, effectively controls the national narrative through a large and disciplined cabinet.

However, vulnerabilities exist. The legal status of Kirk Cornish (North Abaco) and the reputational damage to Sylvannus Petty (North Eleuthera) present specific targets for the Opposition. The narrowing margins in Golden Isles suggest softening PLP support in some constituencies.

Conversely, the FNM is hamstrung by Adrian Gibson's corruption trial (Long Island), the persistent Pintard–Minnis leadership shadow war, and the loss of Iram Lewis to the COI — reducing the party to its smallest House footprint in modern history.

The Constituencies Commission has recommended expanding the House from 39 to 41 seats for the next election. If adopted, this would require redistricting and could reshape the political calculus for both parties.

**Key entities to watch in the coming months:** Darron Pickstock (potential executive elevation), Kingsley Smith (consolidating the West End legacy), Michael Pintard (fighting for political survival as Opposition Leader), and Iram Lewis (testing whether the COI can build beyond a one-seat presence).

This versioned report confirms that as of February 10, 2026, the 39 MPs of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas represent a political system in a state of **PLP hegemony with a three-party parliament** — a configuration unprecedented in the modern era — with a fragmented opposition struggling to find its footing before the next general election.

## Appendix: Senate-Based Cabinet Members (Non-MP Reference)

For completeness, the following Cabinet ministers sit in the Senate rather than the House:

| Senator | Portfolio |
|---------|-----------|
| Ryan Pinder | Attorney General and Minister of Legal Affairs |
| Michael Halkitis | Minister of Economic Affairs |

These individuals are not MPs and do not hold constituency seats.

**Data Reconciliation Notes:**
- Iram Lewis's defection from FNM to COI (April 2, 2025) confirmed via Tribune242, ZNS Bahamas, Magnetic Media, and Jones Bahamas. This changes the House composition from PLP 32 / FNM 7 to PLP 32 / FNM 6 / COI 1.
- Deputy Speaker: McKell Bonaby confirmed per official parliamentary records. Sylvannus Petty (North Eleuthera) serves as backbencher following his WSC resignation — some earlier sources may erroneously list him as Deputy Speaker.
- Spelling of "Sylvannus" / "Sylvanus" Petty varies across official and media sources; both forms appear in government communications.
- Ginger Moxey's legal first name may be "Virginia" based on older records; "Ginger" is her universally recognized name.
