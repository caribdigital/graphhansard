GraphHansard maps the hidden power structure of the Bahamian House of Assembly using graph theory and NLP. It ingests parliamentary audio, identifies who references whom, scores the sentiment, and renders the 39-MP interaction network as an interactive force-directed graph — turning debate into data any voter can explore.
